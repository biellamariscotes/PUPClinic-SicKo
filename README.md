# SicKo

The proposed system, SicKo, addresses this issue by integrating a digital storage of the treatment records. At the same time, to further help the clinic nurse, it also employs a Na√Øve Bayesian Algorithm to swiftly and accurately classify symptoms and diagnose illnesses. By eliminating the need for manual analysis, the system authorizes healthcare professionals, such as nurses or staff, to make informed decisions efficiently. SicKo utilizes user-friendly forms that enable the input of patient information, ensuring a smoother and more accessible process. Additionally, the system generates ready-to-print excuse letters, reducing paperwork and enhancing overall clinic efficiency. The proposed system, SicKo, establishes a centralized repository for clinic documents, specifically the records of treatments.
